## Introduction

Girih patterns have been used for centuries in the architecture of Islamic buildings, manuscripts, and decorative arts. These intricate designs are composed of a combination of geometric shapes, such as stars, polygons, and rosettes, arranged in an aesthetically pleasing manner

## Features

- Display of girih pattern with hover effect
- Responsive design to ensure compatibility with all devices
- Typechecking with PropTypes for better code reliability
- Parcel bundler for no-setup bundling

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up and run the girih project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and yarn installed on your computer.

### Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:
